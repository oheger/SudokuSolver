Sudoku Solver
=============

This is a very simple Java application that calculates a solution for a
sudoku (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

The application has a simple UI allowing the user to enter pre-given
numbers in the corresponding fields. Pressing the Solve button fills out the
remaining fields.

The project is build using Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org/). The
command 
  mvn install
creates a jar which can be directly used to start the application:
  java -jar sudoku-solver-<version>.jar
where <version> is the current version.
